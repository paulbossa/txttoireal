python TK text to irealpro.html import converter
Please enter chord sequence following the for format below no leading '|' bar
    delete this text before you start and songname key etc can be edited 
    after import on ireal editor 
    it just gives a generic import in C and songname for simple chord sequences.
    press convert and it will leave a html file to import into ireal.
    This is in early stages of development so keep chords etc simple and edit on irealpro app.
